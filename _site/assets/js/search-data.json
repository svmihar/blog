            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .

            "content": "wkwk, ikut conference itu feeding ego doang, existentialism . ah masa . neural style transfer, a pycon story. . just why? . well, i’m in a rut of doing nlp stuff, finetuning parameters, climbing the hills and valleys of errors, I needed pelarian something to do without all these metrics. Looking at the empty walls of my rooms, I decided to search for posters to stick on the walls, making my room much more enjoyable to look at. . searching for the fittest within my preferences takes forever to finish, I constraint myself not to do manual design just ol’ plain seeing and printing, and this print is only and gonna be the only one in the world. I want it to be unique and easy! This narrows to: . band posters: meh, too mainstream, it’ll take work to make it “my style” | film posters: i am too volatile to love one particular movies, thus only got the budget for printing one. | quote posters: you got to be kidding me. | motivational quote posters: 🙃 | dian sastro poster So I still got some viable solutions like: . | print a film photograph cost more money, maklum anak kosan | . | edit a photo to look like it was taken from an analog film camera this is basically a filter. | . | . from the filter solution, this looks like the one. I was kinda happy but not satisfied because I’m not a very skilled photographer and not many of my photos amazes me. So I decided to have a different approach with a 3D render, recreating one of my photograph. . Long story short it is too much of a hassle. Props to you all 3D digital artist with all those octane rendering. . Then I saw a tweet from @vngc . TGS 2018 Death Stranding trailer processed through style transfer utilizing the convolutional neural network. Style referenced from the art of Moebius. This current iteration still failed to pick up tiny details and draw finer lines. pic.twitter.com/LM8PfFMT6F . &mdash; izzy (@vngnc) 22 Maret 2019 STYLE TRANSFER! - this is what I am looking for. . This got me hooked! well I can recreate those stuff, it’s only a CNN on a picture! I just needed a painting style and apply it to the photograph of my choosing! . This is surely a “filter” on steroids. . how? . so how does one copy a pattern of brush strokes, the pressure of the brushes to the canvas and the beautiful colors from the original paintings? . let me tell you: edges. . edges is what makes the subject different from the backgorund, contrast in between edges is what defines one brush stroke to the other. Edges is what It’s the edges that we are looking to copy! So how does one copy “an edge” to other image? . now by getting the edges, recreating the edges how does a human can copy a style? well you don’t we leave it to the computationally superior guys to simulate it. the computers. well the computers don’t know what’s an edge is and what’s a picture, what’s a pattern, so they needed a good “kinda look alike edges” from the human world to the computer’s world. How? Representation! . To obtain a representation of a style of an image, how does one define an edge? an edge is what makes a texture. The information, or the “edges” inside the texture is what we’re trying to look for exactly. Then by representing it as an array a computer can easily simulate it in a scale that human can’t. . But what does the computer sees exactly? pixel values. . Because an image is just a bunch of bunch of bunch of numbers in an arrays with the value of red, green and blue values (r,g,b,a). . But, getting the all this texture information how to distinguish between the texture that we are trying to capture and the wholesome arrangement of the image? we’re trying to copy the brush strokes not the subject of the image right? . The representation of the styles is what we will store to an n^th dimension space. Therefore to capture its textual information, this “space” is where the VGG19 comes in. . First of all, the layers in VGG19 will try to search the “correlation” between result of the layers. . Then it will try to deconstruct the input image by downsampling it. . Finally the resulting correlation feature space or the texture we’re trying to copy will match the style to the downsampled image we’re trying to paste our texture to. . Both of these processes are what we’re trying to create resulting a new texture information to the input image, and discarding the arrangement of the pixel from the styled image. . That my friend, is what we’re looking for. The separation of content and style representation. . optimizing the loss . i know making something good means having a good metric to compare to, but this metric we’ll be using is actually the metric that measures the distance between the generated image, to the content and style image. How do you measure the distance between images? gram matrix. Before going to the gram matrix we need to clarify what are the losses . content loss: means the difference between the “content” in the content image to the generated image. | style loss: means the difference between the “style” in the style image to the generated image. How do you measure “content” and “style”? like all mathematicians, to measure a distance we need two points to measure on. We map the content image to a hilbert space using the VGG19’s feature layer, making it a vector, then map the style image and generated image also. These vectors can be measured from the distances, seeing it as how far is it different from each other. The gram matrix is the result of the inner product of the vectors. This actually shows the spatial correlation between the images. Think of it as a historgram. It doesn’t measure specific pixel to pixel or a location of the images. It calculate only the feature distribution that we wanted. | . feature extractors x transfer learning. . My favorite. Transfer learning is used to extract what you call a texture information on an image. How do you extract it is by mapping the “patterns” of an image to a feature layer. The Think of this transfer learning as a baseline of our model, the model itself (VGG19), is a CNN architecture which used 15 million images from the ImageNet dataset, and trained on a 138 million parameters that uses 5 convolutional layers. By using VGG’s pretrained models, our model doesn’t need to learn from scratch and saving a lot of time and space, by only fine tuning the top layers, on what we wanted it to output (generated image). Both weight and biases from the pretrained model is what the feature extractors are. Diffrentiating which is which, edges, patterns, textures, brush strokes, colors, etc. . implementation . using pytorch: . generated a white noise for the generated image | adding style and content from the extracted features from both the content and style image | backprop and gradient descent step optimized using L-BFGS to find the loss function score | iterate till satisified with result The L-BFGS is just a work around on a smaller GPU capability. My implementation on this is actually stack 10 scripts on each other, changing its initiation image to the output image from the previous script output. to produce image, from the 10 scripts: | using google colab: 3045 seconds | using gradient’s p5000: 971s | . other implementation . maps, on maps | painting on paintings | . parting words . I am deeply honored to be invited to be the speaker on pycon indo 2019 about this however, to make the project “demo-able” i made several improvements: . cycleGAN | fast-style-neural-trasnfer Both are a pretty good “feature extractors” with way different implementation to each other. But both has a pretty good serializeable file that I can use to generate a new image without training it again and again. Creating CLI is cool and stuff, but I decided to take a step further by making a telegram bot, try it out while its still online @styletransferbot! | . I learned a lot of things about the GANs, making art with deep learning. Sometimes learning machine learning is all about metrics: getting good prediction, less error, less biased towards certain things, more reliable and good black box models, what I get from this is programming in the society should be changed from a tool for industries to something more! something that helps us to be more expressive as humans. . Stop making weapons of math destructions! . Well I guess decorating my room got hell bent to a long hole of optimization problem eh. .",

Diajak ikutan berarti asumsi awal adalah mengikuti seminar tentang data mining, bukan mengisi kan, karena dirasa saya masih perlu banyak belajar jadi saya memutuskan secara langsung gak pake mikir buat ikutan. Ternyata tidak disini diajak ikutan adalah menjadi pembicara. Awal ngeh itu ketika disuruh bikin penjelasaan algoritma SVM, Kmeans dan heiarchical. Ketika ditanya buat apa, ternyata disuruh ngisi. . hint #0. cara menaklukan hewan buas seperti mengimplementasikan dan membuat sebuah algoritma ternyata berbeda dengan menaklukan orang-orang yang ingin belajar. . hint #1. it’s not something that i really enjoy. it’s like debugging an app, but instead of one app, you’re debugging a whole class of errors. Like playing chess, but instead of 1 opponent, you’re actually playing with several people at the same time. . TLDR; simpler learning material, approach sesuai dengan background dari pesertanya or having a pre-course material given before the workshop, and having an evalution metrics whatever metric type. . lesson(s) given . of course python. pake sklearn, scipy, pandas dan numpy. oh matplotlib juga. should’ve gone with seaborn tho. . super basic sih, mainly about: . machine learning algorithms clustering: kmeans, agglomerative, dendogram | classification: svm with linear, rbf and polynomial kernels | . | exploratory data analysis making sense of data with pearson coefficient | mencari korelasi antar feature di kolom | . | data visualization basics of matplotlib. | . | . disini sebenernya lebih kepada showcasing ketimbang mengajakarkan cara membuatnya. dimana implementasi algoritma dijelaskan dengan lancar tapi memvisualisasikannya agak “cacat” karena tidak terbiasa mengotak-atik sebuah visualisasi. i should’ve go with seaborn. but i went with matplotlib instead (i’m assuming they are aware of matplotlib because it’s literally derived from the matlab plot library. they don’t.) . oh iya sama beberapa subtle “hints” of github. dimana resource sharing disini tinggal ambil dari github. . lesson(s) learned . should have gone with more structurized material . bukan beberapa ide yang “mashed together” menjadi pembelajaran, ternyata gak belajar. malah error debugging. . should’ve gone with the handout type. . you can read the comments, people without any programming background find it hard to see comments in code. use jupyternotebook markdown instead. have some latex to type the equations. (i did this, but still hard to grasp i guess.) . longer. . coding workshop is not mere 3-4 hours of talking. it’s mainly error debugging. saya berdiri di depan dengan asumsi semua sudah nyaman dengan python. ternyata tidak. yang terjadi pada saat itu adalah saya ngetik sendiri yang lainnya hanya mereka karena saya terlalu cepat. . make clear boilerplates (noob proof). . boilerplates diciptakan untuk mempercepat proses yang redundant. bukan menciptakan kebingungan yang lebih. sebebernya boilerplate nya sudah ada hanya saja akan tetapi dataset yang disediakan sudah terlalu advanced untuk membuat proof of concept. . clear backgoround about the peserta. . cukup menjadi masalah karena boilerplate yang disediakan bukan untuk non coder. jadinya ya berantakan. akhirnya malah saya sendiri yang asik di depan sementara pesertanya hanya planga plongo tidak mengerti apa yang terjadi pada datanya. bahkan melihat pip install sklearn saja sudah merasa menjadi programmer. okay welcome to the darkside then i guess. . more practice on public speaking. . seharusnya sudah tau di depan itu mau ngobrol tentang apa. terlalu advanced topiknya? jadikan diskusi. terlalu gampang topik di depan? jadikan game. skill inilah sebenernya yang bisa “adapt vastly” kepada penontonnya. memang si speaker yang memandu si penontonnya tapi penontonnya harus tau tujuan akhir bagaimanapun proses menuju tujuan akhirnya. . have some music. . it’s not a damn test. relax. buat beberapa games untuk memecah suasana, memperkecil jarak dari penonton ke pembicara. . . improvements . suitable internet connection . i know it’s indonesia assume bad internet at all times. but come on. at this scale the facilitator should’ve had priavte fast speed internet connection. you think datasets and api calls are small bandwith stuff? . pre course material. . have the peserta learned up, jadi ketika diterangkan bisa lebih ngeh dengan apa yang tidak dimengerti dan mengerti apa yang tidak diketahui. . pre-test-post-test cycle. . biar tau apakah ada improvement sebelum dan sesudah workshop. . longer. . seriously. 3-4 hours of pengantar data science itu tidak cukup. i’m trying bootcamp style. . hotel . the guest house is nice tho. i guess calling it a hotel itu lebih pantes. but… .

Alasan “mandek kreatifitas” menjadi solusi. “Belum dapet mood (suasana dalam gambar) yang bagus ni buat mas ini nih”. Sampai akhirnya terpaksa meniru mood dari produksi lain. Sampai pada suatu masa dimana seluruh foto selesai di edit harus di render dan, mati lampu. . Sebagai seorang yang berat di otak kiri saya memikirkan 3 solusi. Saya ke warkop langganan saya dimana ada pasokan listrik yang memadai dan internet yang lebih dari cukup kecepatannya untuk upload, atau ke lab komputasi dimana semuanya ada dan tinggal colok kabel LAN saja dan bisa offload render di komputer lab atau menunggu. Lekas saya mandi dan bersiap untuk ke Lab karena terkait masalah ekonomi saya memutuskan untuk upload di lab. Seolah alam tidak ingin saya pergi, hujan pun datang, jas hujan dipinjam. Seolah tidak ingin membuang duit untuk menyewa GrabCar saya memutuskan untuk menunggu dalam gelap. . Perasaan tidak melakukan apa-apa seolah tak berdaya tidak dapat “produktif demi interdependensi manusia” memnpm buat saya berpikir. Apakah manusia disebut berguna ketika dia bekerja untuk orang lain? Apakah manusia menemukan jati dirinya ketika diakui oleh orang lain? Lantas orang lain itu siapa untuk mendefinisikan jati diri kita? Apakah kita dapat menemukan jati diri kita dari kehampaan? . Dari sini perasaan dimana tidak dapat melakukan apa-apa itu sedikit demi sedikit membuat saya teringat dulu. Ketika kewajiban hanyalah untuk diri pribadi, tanggung jawab tidak sebesar dan sedewasa diri ini, belum mempunyai makna untuk berguna bagi sesama, interdependensi. . jadi apakah interdependensimu didefinisikan dari pekerjaan mu? atau dari kehampaan kamu dapat tetap berguna bagi lingkunganmu? . Rasa hampa ini membuat saya bergidik ngeri akan rasanya menuruti kedangingan manusia untuk menunda. . From a quick cheer to a standing ovation, clap to show how much you enjoyed this story. .",
