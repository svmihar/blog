# podcast bagi saya adalah...  
bagi saya podcast adalah seperti radio di mobil. semua mobil punya, dan bisa mengaksesnya tapi disitu hanya sebagai menemani sepi atau sekedar mengisi kekosongan ketika habis topiknya. Background noise. 

# apps 
the only app I use since the start is castbox.fm, karena ada beberapa fitur yang cukup krusial untuk menjadi app podcast yang memenuhi batas bawah standar saya. hehe: 
- web, android, ios supported
- time syncing
  - wherever whenever whatever device yang saya pake, bisa lanjut where i left off. 
- offline support
  - this is indonesia. expect bad internet at all times. 
i'm trying spotify because of the community but no offline support except if you're subbed to the premium which i'm not because i'm broke af. so no spotify for me. 
other contenders are google podcast and pocket cast, but google podcast didn't have any linux love :( and pocket cast is just too much hassle to try. 

i'm sticking to [castbox.fm](https://castbox.fm/)

# things that i listened to: 
## programming 
i code mainly on python and javascript so 
for python: 
- Talk Python to me: u python? u listen this. **nuff said**. *Release* weekly
- Data Skeptic: data science topics, interesting guests, even discusses scientific Q1-Q3 papers/journals interesting host, because husband and wife. 
- Syntax: orang gaul-nya javascript and web dev in general. Not only programming covers up little details about programming I tend to brush off. Good stuff if you're still learning and no bias around lgbt. 
- SuperDataScience: this is some career stuff talking. 
## productivity
- Developer Tea: super singkat like 10 minutes podcast. Good when listening when having coffee, discusses how normal people see programmers and how to "act" like a ninja/rockstar/[buzzword_here] programmer
## life
- 
## couples and relationship

## music. 

# parting words
